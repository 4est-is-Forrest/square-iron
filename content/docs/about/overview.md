#### Details

###### IT Support (I-II) Role

**_Overview_** - Much of my first year with Atos was spent as a Tier I agent that sometimes came across Tier II issues with our corporate and enterprise clients. Our communication mediums with users at the time were either phone or email. Two key factors helped me rapidly grow into and eventually out of this role. Firstly, I had started working on my IT focused degree at NKU during this time and secondly, I had (and still have) a tenacious troubleshooting nature.

**_Education_** - In retrospect, I think having the ability to take what I was learning in class and immediately apply it in my full-time IT work environment was immensely educational in my academic and practical understanding of technologies I was learning and using on both fronts. This of course, provided a significant advantage when diagnosing and troubleshooting in my role given my comprehensive knowledge of various IT elements and how those elements interacted with one another.  

**_Tenacity_** - To elaborate on my 'tenacious troubleshooting nature,' in one aspect, I've always had a strong reluctance to route our tickets we create to a resolver group, especially if that resolver group has other priorities or is known to have a high volume of tickets in their queue already. In the context of a single-user type issue, being solved by myself would generally be faster than if I had routed the issue off. In another aspect, I genuinely enjoy tackling difficult technical problems and issues. I cite this nature as an advantage because it has always yielded something in return. Whether it was practicing my skills in searching for answers and information, discovering a fix or locating the root cause for a specific problem, I always ended up learning something new which I innately find rewarding.

**_Lastly_** - The combination of these two factors helped me to rapidly adapt to a career in technology and are major reasons why I was able to quickly grow far beyond my Help Desk role.
