## Details

#### _Network Design and Troubleshooting_

As noted in the 'Academic Experience' section, a single course I completed had this very title. It provided a lot of valuable Cisco console experience, troubleshooting and debugging strategies as well as practice with setting up and fixing routing protocols. The lab setting largely existed within GNS3 but a sizable amount of lab work was also done in a physical network lab.

Beyond the class devoted to role, many other courses allowed me to practice what I had learned and provided critical experience with the networking layer. Systems Administration, Network Security and Advanced Cyber Security also required critical thinking of concepts and tools learned in previous fundamental networking classes as well as "Network Design and Troubleshooting."

As I gained more experience with these networking technologies, I was able to apply that knowledge in my professional environment. It opened up some previously unknown doors when utilizing Python and I became much more comfortable with applying and utilizing these skills in a professional capacity.

#### _Windows & Linux Environments (Servers & Clients)_

Much of my Windows experience came from my work environment which was a mix of Windows 7 and 10. My confidence with Linux distributions stems from NKU's program largely favoring CentOS, Kali Linux, Ubuntu and Metasploit for our practice environments.

When it comes to Windows Clients, I'm extremely comfortable navigating, troubleshooting, utilizing PowerShell and especially interacting with the OS and other Microsoft products using Python's win32api (pywin32). My 'Windows Administration' course provided important hands-on experience with Windows Server which led to applying this knowledge to setup/configure an Active Directory server for a project based around Radius.

NKU requires a Unix class be completed before moving onto 300 and 400 level. The class was focused on the fundamentals of the console as well as gave us the tools and strategies to find our own answers with regard to navigating and understanding Linux distributions. This is one of the main reasons, in my opinion,  NKU students come out of the IT program very fluent with Linux environments. When encouraged to seek out our own answers while still providing help resources, I felt I had a better understanding of the technology itself and the technology surrounding it.

#### _Systems Administration_

One of the most immersive role-based classes was the course "Advanced Systems and Network Administration." The class provided our previously designated teams with four CentOS clients and one CentOS server. 

The class revolved around aspects of IT from an administrative view, which encompassed topics such as different support layers (help desk, etc.), LDAP, monitoring tools and backup methods. Our projects involved initially settings up the VM's automatically with a mix of Kickstart and our choice of scripting language. Another project was to automate the configuration of LDAP and network folders. Our last projects required a comprehensive Monit system be implemented on all of our VM's.

#### _Automation Design & Implementation_

Comprising the vast majority of my time with Atos, I wrote tools and scripts that completed many processes of varying complexity and specification. Anywhere from general tools designed to eliminate 90% of the necessary labor associated with converting large amounts of emails into ServiceNow tickets to iterating an Excel sheet and making specific decisions based off that data.

Much of my experience and knowledge with automation can be better illustrated in my 'Code Samples' Section. 

#### _Tier 1 & 2 IT Support_

Initially how I spent my time at Atos. Mostly with Tier I but as I progressed through college and was practicing more and more with Python, I became much more useful automating processes, performing data collection and analysis, and sometimes following up on interesting Tier II issues.

#### _Cyber, System & Network Security_

Having taken courses specifically devoted to each of these fields as well as my major being entirely built around the subject of security in technology, I naturally feel comfortable around the roles. The course 'Advanced Cyber Security' focused on practically every subject from Social Engineering to WireShark surveillance and analysis. In all classes we were provided a look into offensive tactics and how to mitigate them as well as concepts based around prevention.

My academic experience with security in technology caused me early on to write my Python code with security always in mind. I'm never satisfied unless I've managed to balance convenience with a solid and secure foundation for many of them.

#### _Web Application Development_

The course in 'Web Development,' and some of the content from 'Web Server Administration' contributed to my interest in learning Flask. My curiosity stemmed mostly from my interest in familiarizing myself with parts of the Google Cloud platform and specifically Google's App Engine. 

Learning and utilizing Flask took some effort but I was able to construct a basic web application in about four days on my first attempt. Over the course of this personal project, I learned a great deal about front-end and back-end development, Jinja2's templating engine, web security and NoSQL like databases (Google Cloud Datastore).

One of my early projects in college was to build a simple ticketing website built on a LAMP server platform (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and Python in my case). Naturally, this provided practice and understanding of a variety of technologies, among them being Web Application Development.

#### _Data Collection, Storage, Analysis & Reporting_

The collection and storage aspect stems from my usage of Python to query ServiceNow tables in order to create compartmentalized and readily accessible data objects for use by my tools and scripts across the team. 

Analysis and reporting derive from my constant utilization of the Pandas Python library to analyze automatically collected data and usually produce a formatted report for the leadership (mostly with the Openpyxl module).

If code samples related to this are not posted, they will be coming soon.

#### _Database Administration_

Primarily in an academic capacity as far as Oracle. I am, however, familiar with SQL as a language and have experience managing my own MySQL and NoSQL-type databases.
