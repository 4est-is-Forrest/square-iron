## Technology Details

#### _Web Services and REST API's_

I use ServiceNow's JSON Web Service API regularly in my code. As explained in my 'Code Samples' section, I utilize JSON as work around for lack of sufficient permissions to ServiceNow's REST API, but the JSON Web Service is better than nothing. I encode my POSTs in the URL and attach JSON objects mostly to create tickets. It is also my go to method to query 'sys_ids' and other object attributes associated with said object.

I have taken advantage of a few different API's Google Cloud has to offer, RESTful or otherwise. 

#### _Google Cloud Platform_

Much of my experience encompasses general navigation of both the console and shell as well as more specific features like Google App Engine, Google API's, and Google Datastore. 

Aside from the web application I made to familiarize myself with a variety of elements, another project I tackled with in the Google Cloud environment was a simple Python program that converted and submitted audio to Google's Speech-to-Text API and return the text output to file.

#### _ServiceNow_

At Atos, I worked with a variety of ticketing systems but almost all of them were different instances of the ServiceNow platform. My experience includes GUI navigation, ServiceNow's Client JavaScript, URL encoded queries and ServiceNow's web services (JSON, CSV, Excel).

In my efforts to automate as well as work around road blocks, I understand a great deal about the inner working of ServiceNow.
