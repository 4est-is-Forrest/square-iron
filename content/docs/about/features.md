## **Bachelor of Science: Computer Information Technology**

* **Northern Kentucky University**
* **December 2019**
* **Cyber Security Specialty**
* **Information Security Minor**

<hr>

### **Summary**

My degree program is characterized as 'Computer Information Technology' and with that, I choose to pursue the Cyber Security specialty track. I also elected to pursue a minor in Information Security.

### **Environment Context**

The overwhelming majority of NKU's computer related courses were and are taught exclusively on Linux distributions such as CentOS, Kali Linux, and Ubuntu. Both servers and clients were largely virtual, but sometimes physical.

The NKU's network specific courses were equally divided between physical and virtual (GNS3) lab environments. All equipment and platforms were entirely Cisco and usually these classes used Cisco Cert books as the required textbook.

### **Course Details**

#### _Web Development & Elementary Programming_

**Web Development** began on fundamental HTML/CSS elements and ended on an introduction into JavaScript functions and application with web pages.

**Elementary Programming** was exclusively taught using the Java implementation of Python: Jython. Basic concepts that are common to a wide range of languages were explored and practiced such as variables, functions, lists, dictionaries and loops.

I attribute these classes as laying the groundwork toward my strong interest in learning and practicing Python.

#### _Windows Administration & Unix Systems_

**Windows Administration** focused on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2015, delving into common system settings, administrative tools and a thorough introduction into PowerShell.

**Unix Systems** was a prerequisite given much of the curriculum ahead was almost entirely taught on Linux distributions. The course set out to familiarize students with utilizing the bash console to accomplish any administrative objective or task. Bash scripting was also introduced. 

By this point, I had already been working in IT for nearly two years and beginning to rapidly gain confidence with Python. I was already experienced with many of the Windows topics but I still learned a great deal. The Unix class provided the tools and knowledge to confidently navigate and find answers within a console, and allowed me to tackle my following classes and personal projects with confidence.

#### _Technical Writing & IT Project Management_

**Technical Writing** revolved around creating manuals and other documents meant to explain a process. 

**IT Project Management** introduced the elements that go into creating, implementing, maintaining and finishing IT projects. Outside of textbook work, we worked in groups on our own IT projects for fictional clients, iterating through each phase (Initiation, Planning, Execution, Performance, Close).

While I did have some experience attaching documentation to my work projects, I learned a great deal about best practices when it comes to technical writing. IT Project Management provided hands on experience with the Waterfall model, but also provided insight into comparing the Waterfall model with Agile.

#### _Network Design & Troubleshooting_

This class' objective was to introduce students to physical Cisco equipment, using the Cisco console on routers and switches, ACLS, troubleshooting and debug strategies, and common routing protocols (EIGRP & OSPF). Often our assignments consisted of a broken GNS3 network that we were tasked with diagnosing and repairing.

#### _Scripting I & II_

By the start of these classes, I had already been active with Python in my job environment. Ruby was the language of choice for the class, and given how similar Python and Ruby are, I was very familiar with many or all of the concepts we went over. 

#### _Web Server Administration_

Our lab medium consisted of Apache hosted on a Linux server. The learning objectives revolved around Apache configuration file syntax, use of several common Apache modules, server & site security, file tree structures and PHP.

For the class' final project, I created a web hosted ticketing system built on a LAMP platform; Linux, Apache, MySQL and Python in my case. This was large step forward in my understanding of technology planes and how they interacted with one another as well as how Python can interact with them. I learned to setup, change, query database data and serve it using Python, revealing a great deal of possibilities I hadn't known at the time. This LAMP project helped a great deal when it came time to learn and use Flask. 

#### _Advanced Network & System Administration_

Ultimately a Systems Administration course. We learned and practiced all responsibilities any Linux admin would be expected to perform or monitor. 

Divided into small teams, we were provided a virtual environment with one Linux server and four Linux clients. The team projects involving this environment consisted first of scripting and automating the configuration of all five VM's (OS install, account/system configuration, Apache installation, etc.) utilizing a combination of Bootstrap and our choice of scripting language. All projects including LDAP setup and migration, network folder configuration and Monit utilization to monitor the environment, involved automating some or all of the project's process and/or objective.

Familiar with Python in a Windows, learning to accomplish goals in Linux administration environment was an extremely valuable experience and actually carried over into my work within Windows.

#### _Computer Forensics, Advanced Cyber Security, Network Security_

**Computer Forensics** revealed clearer insights into many security related topics as well as introduce new ones. Provided VM's consisted of Metasploit, Windows XP and Kali Linux. The course taught methods of data collection and duplication, remote tools, code analysis, Snort usage and the fields best practices to name a few.

**Advanced Cyber Security** introduced threat and malware definitions, compromised network detection, report composition, web application security and Cyber Security laws and compliance.

**Network Security** consisted of topics such as AAA, Securing Layer 2, Firewall fundamentals, ACLs, ASAs & DMZ Configuration and IPS/IDS implementation. Every week, we performed a lab that was either implementing that week's topic or we performed attacks (CAM Table Overflow, SYN Flood) and practiced strategies to mitigate those attacks.
