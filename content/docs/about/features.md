### Summary

My degree program is characterized as 'Computer Information Technology' and with that, I choose to pursue the Cyber Security specialty track. I also elected to pursue a minor in Information Security.

### Environment Context

The overwhelming majority of NKU's computer related courses were and are taught exclusively on Linux distributions such as CentOS, Kali Linux, and Ubuntu. Both servers and clients were largely virtual, but sometimes physical.

The NKU's network specific courses were equally physical lab and virtual (GNS3) practice environments. All equipment and platforms were entirely Cisco and usually these classes directly utilized Cisco Cert books as the class's required textbook.
