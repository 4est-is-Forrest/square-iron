## Role Experience

#### _Network Design and Troubleshooting_

As noted in the 'Academic Experience' section, a single course had this title. It provided a lot of valuable Cisco console experience, troubleshooting and debugging strategies and practice with routing protocols. The lab class' setting was largely based in GNS3 but a sizable amount of lab work was also done in physical network lab at NKU. 

Beyond the class devoted to role, many other courses allowed me to practice what I know and provide an opportunity to learn hands on. Systems Administration, Network Security and Advanced Cyber Security also required critical thinking of concepts learned in previous fundamental classes as well as "Network Design and Troubleshooting."

As I gained more experience with these networking technologies, I was able to apply that practical experience in my professional environment. It opened up some previously unknown doors when utilizing Python and I became comfortable with applying and utilizing these skills in a professional capacity. 

#### Windows & Linux Environments (Servers & Clients)

Much of my Windows experience came from my work environment which was a mix of Windows 7 and 10. My confidence with Linux distributions stems from NKU's program largely favoring CentOS, Kali Linux, Ubuntu and Metasploit for learning in a practice environment. 

When it comes to Windows Clients, I'm extremely comfortable navigating, troubleshooting, utilizing PowerShell and especially interacting with the OS and other Microsoft products using Python's win32api (pywin32). My 'Windows Administration' provided import hands-on experience with Windows Server which lead to using this knowledge to setup Active Directory and 

NKU requires a Unix class be completed before moving onto 300 and 400 level. The class was immensely helpful but in the end, it primarily gave us the tools and strategies to find our own answers with regard to navigating and understanding Linux distributions. I attribute this as the reason so many NKU students come out the program with legitimate practical experience. When forced to work things out ourselves while providing help sources, it surprised me how familiar Linux felt while installing Apache on it or utilize Python 2 to class objectives.
