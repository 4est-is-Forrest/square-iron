A quick summary for the scripts/tools 'Tasks' and 'Incidents.'

## Summary

These scripts are dependent on the two modules '[Inbox Common](/docs/inbox-common-module/)' and '[Connectors](/docs/connectors/)' described in detail in their respective document sections. 

Once arguments have been inserted into an email's subject line, that email can then be placed in a folder for processing by these scripts.

_See this_ [_document_]() _for argument reference._
