title: Inbox Automation

---
This section is devoted to a tool set I designed to automate the vast majority of work associated with a help desk inbox. 

<hr />

## Problem

The particular inbox this tool set was designed for is a high volume help desk inbox. Emails this inbox receives must be processed to become tickets or filed away with acknowledgement tags.

Initially, additional team members were brought on to exclusively process emails while the rest of the team were expected to process emails in between calls.

This "system" as I call it, is composed of three scripts and two modules I created. For now this section will only cover two of the scripts and the two modules.
